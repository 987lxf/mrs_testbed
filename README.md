# Multi-robot Exploration Testbed #

This testbed includes:
- ROS packages for multi-robot exploration
- MORSE simulation scenarios
- Scripts for autonomous deployment of the testbed infrastructure and experiments

To have a general idea of the testbed, please refer to two videos below, respectively showing simulation and real robot experiments:
