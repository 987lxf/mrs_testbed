# Multi-robot Exploration Testbed #

This testbed includes:
- ROS packages for multi-robot exploration
- [MORSE](https://github.com/morse-simulator/morse) simulation scenarios
- Scripts for autonomous deployment of the infrastructure and experiments

To have a general idea, please refer to the videos below, respectively showing simulated and real robot exploration:

## Overview ##

The testbed is composed of four parts: a simulator, a monitor, a set of robot controllers, and the ROS middleware used to connect all of them. In particular, we use the MORSE 3D realistic simulator and wrap it up into a ROS node. The monitor is also performed as a ROS node, which allows us to supervise the experimental processes. Specifically, it can stop the experiment when the stop condition is triggered, collect measurement data and compute the metrics afterwards.
