# Multi-robot Exploration Testbed #

This testbed includes:
- ROS packages for multi-robot exploration
- MORSE simulation scenarios
- Scripts for autonomous deployment of the infrastructure and experiments

To have a general idea, please refer to the videos below, respectively showing simulated and real robot exploration:
