Inspired by the RoboCup Rescue competition, We provide here four experimental terrains created with the same size but different topological structures:

* The `loop` terrain has a low obstacle density and a simple obstacle shape, in which there is no road fork (similar to beltway).
* The `cross` terrain contains five road forks but the obstacle density is still low (similar to crossroad).
* The `zigzag` terrain has no road fork but more obstacles, and it has a long solution path for the robot (similar to square-grid street).
* The `maze` terrain is the most complex which contains many obstacles and dead ends (similar to whole city).


One can use this robot to build map of an environment
